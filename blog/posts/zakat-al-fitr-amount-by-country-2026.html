          <p>Zakat al-Fitr (also called Fitrana or Sadaqah al-Fitr) is a mandatory charitable giving due before Eid al-Fitr prayer. It is separate from the annual Zakat on wealth. Every Muslim who possesses more food than they need on Eid must pay it, and the amount varies by country based on the local cost of staple food. Here are the 2026 amounts by country, plus everything you need to know about who must pay, what the deadline is, and how to fulfill this obligation.</p>

          <h2>What is Zakat al-Fitr?</h2>

          <p>Zakat al-Fitr, known in Arabic as Sadaqah al-Fitr, is an obligatory form of charity that every Muslim must pay at the end of Ramadan, before the Eid al-Fitr prayer. It is one of the five pillars of Islam, distinct from Zakat al-Mal (the annual wealth Zakat that many people are more familiar with).</p>

          <p>The core obligation is simple: if you are a Muslim and you have food beyond your immediate needs on the day and night of Eid, you must give Zakat al-Fitr. Historically, it was paid in the form of staple food — such as wheat, barley, dates, or rice — at a quantity of approximately one sa' per person (roughly 2.5kg to 2.7kg depending on the Islamic school of thought you follow). In modern times, the vast majority of Muslims and Islamic organizations permit paying the <strong>cash equivalent</strong> of that food amount, which is far more practical and helps charities distribute aid more efficiently.</p>

          <p>The obligation is <strong>per-person</strong>. You pay it for yourself and on behalf of every dependent in your household: your spouse, your children (even newborns), and elderly parents in your care if you are supporting them.</p>

          <p>The payment must be made <strong>before the Eid al-Fitr prayer</strong>. Many scholars recommend paying in the last few days of Ramadan so that charities have time to distribute the funds to eligible recipients before Eid morning.</p>

          <h2>Zakat al-Fitr Amounts by Country 2026</h2>

          <p>The amount of Zakat al-Fitr you owe is determined by local Islamic organizations based on the current price of staple food in your region. Below is a guide to typical amounts in major countries and regions for 2026. Always check with your local mosque or an established Islamic charity in your country for their officially published Fitrana rate, as these amounts may vary by organization and are updated annually based on food costs.</p>

          <table class="zakat-amounts-table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Country / Region</th>
                <th>Currency</th>

                <td>SAR</td>
                <td>25–30 per person</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Pakistan</strong></td>
                <td>PKR</td>
                <td>300–500 per person</td>

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <p><strong>Note:</strong> These amounts are guidelines based on typical staple food prices in each region. Organizations update their rates annually as food costs change. If you see a range, some organizations within that country set their rate at the lower end while others use the higher amount. Always check with your local mosque, Islamic center, or a trusted charity operating in your country for their officially published rate before paying. This ensures your Fitrana is calculated according to the most current local standards.</p>

          <h2>Who Must Pay Zakat al-Fitr?</h2>

          <p>Zakat al-Fitr is obligatory on <strong>every Muslim</strong> who meets these simple conditions:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Muslim:</strong> You follow Islam and believe in Allah and the message of Prophet Muhammad.</li>
            <li><strong>Adult or has a guardian:</strong> If you are a child, your parents or guardian must pay on your behalf.</li>
            <li><strong>Possesses excess food:</strong> You have food beyond what you and your dependents need to eat on the day and night of Eid. This is a very low threshold — if you have any savings or means, you almost certainly qualify.</li>
            <li><strong>Not in debt that consumes all your wealth:</strong> If you are in extreme financial hardship (rare), some scholars exempt you, but most say Fitrana still applies.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Importantly, Zakat al-Fitr is <strong>not based on your total wealth</strong> like Zakat al-Mal. You can be a student with minimal savings and still owe Fitrana if you have any money for food. Conversely, a wealthy person pays the same per-person amount as someone with modest means.</p>

          <p>You must also pay Zakat al-Fitr <strong>on behalf of every dependent</strong> in your household:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Spouse:</strong> You pay for your husband or wife.</li>
            <li><strong>Children:</strong> Including newborns born before Eid. If a child is born on Eid day itself, some scholars exempt that child for that year (since the obligation arises at sunset on the night of Eid), but paying for them is still recommended.</li>
            <li><strong>Parents and elderly relatives:</strong> If elderly parents or other family members live with you and you are their primary source of support, you pay on their behalf.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What Can Zakat al-Fitr Be Paid In?</h2>

          <p>Traditionally, Zakat al-Fitr was paid in staple foods: wheat, barley, dates, rice, or other grains common in the Muslim community. This practice dates back to the time of Prophet Muhammad and emphasizes the connection to food and sustenance.</p>

          <p><strong>In modern times, paying the cash equivalent is widely accepted and even preferred.</strong> Most contemporary Islamic scholars and every major Islamic organization worldwide now permits Fitrana to be paid in cash, calculated as the current market value of one sa' of staple food. This approach has several advantages:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Charities can use the cash to purchase food exactly where and when it is needed, reducing waste.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Donors can pay easily through online platforms, bank transfers, or in-person donations.</li>
            <li><strong>Reach:</strong> Cash allows organizations to help recipients in regions where staple food prices may differ.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You may distribute your Zakat al-Fitr directly to eligible recipients if you know them personally (such as a poor neighbor), or you may donate to a recognized Islamic charity. For lists of trusted organizations in your country, see our guide on <a href="best-islamic-charities-2026.html">Best Islamic Charities for Zakat 2026</a>.</p>

          <h2>When Must Zakat al-Fitr Be Paid? The Eid Deadline</h2>

          <p>The timing of Zakat al-Fitr is <strong>strict and specific</strong>. Unlike Zakat al-Mal, which you have a full lunar year to pay, Fitrana has a defined window:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Obligation begins:</strong> At sunset on the last day of Ramadan (the night of Eid), the obligation to pay Zakat al-Fitr becomes binding.</li>
            <li><strong>Must be paid before:</strong> The Eid al-Fitr prayer on Eid morning.</li>
            <li><strong>Recommended timing:</strong> Pay in the last few days of Ramadan so that charities can distribute it to the poor before Eid celebrations begin.</li>
            <li><strong>If you miss the deadline:</strong> Paying after Eid prayer is considered a form of voluntary Sadaqah (charity), not Zakat al-Fitr. While still rewarded, it does not fulfill the Fitrana obligation.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For 2026, Eid al-Fitr is expected around <strong>March 30–31</strong>, depending on the Islamic lunar calendar and the sighting of the new moon. Check with your local mosque or Islamic organization for the exact date once the new moon is sighted. Many organizations begin accepting Zakat al-Fitr payments in the last week of Ramadan (roughly March 24–29) to ensure timely distribution.</p>

          <h2>Zakat al-Fitr vs Zakat al-Mal (Wealth Zakat)</h2>

          <p>Many Muslims confuse these two obligatory forms of charity. Here is a clear comparison:</p>

          <table class="comparison-table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Aspect</th>
                <th>Zakat al-Fitr (Fitrana)</th>
                <th>Zakat al-Mal (Wealth Zakat)</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Calculation</strong></td>
                <td>Fixed amount per person</td>
                <td>2.5% of total zakatable wealth</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Who pays</strong></td>
                <td>Every Muslim with excess food</td>
                <td>Muslims with wealth above Nisab</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>When paid</strong></td>
                <td>End of Ramadan, before Eid prayer</td>
                <td>Once per lunar year (whenever your Zakat date falls)</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Hawl requirement</strong></td>
                <td>No — paid regardless of how long you've held assets</td>
                <td>Yes — wealth must be held for one lunar year</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Basis</strong></td>
                <td>Sustenance and food</td>
                <td>Accumulated wealth (savings, investments, gold, etc.)</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Nisab threshold</strong></td>
                <td>Not applicable — anyone with excess food pays</td>
                <td>Required (approx. $7,500–$8,500 in gold value for 2026)</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <p>Both are obligatory Islamic duties, but they serve different purposes. Zakat al-Fitr purifies the fasting person and ensures the poor can celebrate Eid with dignity and food. Zakat al-Mal purifies wealth and supports the needy throughout the year.</p>

          <h2>Using ZakatEasy for Zakat al-Mal</h2>

          <p>While Zakat al-Fitr is a straightforward fixed amount per person, calculating your <strong>annual Zakat al-Mal</strong> (wealth Zakat) is more complex. You need to gather all your assets — cash, gold, silver, investments, business inventory, receivables — and calculate 2.5% of the total after deducting liabilities and the Nisab threshold.</p>

          <p>This is where the <a href="../../index.html">ZakatEasy calculator</a> helps. Our free tool:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Fetches <strong>live gold and silver prices</strong> so your Nisab threshold is always current</li>
            <li>Automatically converts prices to your local currency (USD, GBP, CAD, AUD, etc.)</li>
            <li>Lets you input all your assets — cash, gold, silver, investments, business assets</li>
            <li>Calculates your exact Zakat al-Mal obligation in seconds</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <h3>How much is Zakat al-Fitr per person in 2026?</h3>

          <p>Zakat al-Fitr in 2026 is approximately <strong>$10–$15 per person in the USA</strong>, <strong>£5–£7 in the UK</strong>, and <strong>CAD $15–$20 in Canada</strong>. The exact amount is set by local Islamic organizations based on the cost of approximately 2.5kg of staple food. Check with your local mosque or a trusted Islamic charity for their published rate for 2026.</p>

          <h3>When is the deadline to pay Zakat al-Fitr in 2026?</h3>

          <p>Zakat al-Fitr must be paid <strong>before the Eid al-Fitr prayer</strong> in 2026. Eid al-Fitr 2026 is expected around <strong>March 30–31</strong> depending on moon sighting. Many scholars recommend paying in the last few days of Ramadan so charities can distribute it before Eid morning. Paying after Eid prayer is considered voluntary Sadaqah rather than Zakat al-Fitr.</p>

          <h3>Do I pay Zakat al-Fitr for my children?</h3>

          <p>Yes. Zakat al-Fitr is obligatory on every Muslim who has sufficient means — and you must also pay it on behalf of all dependents in your household, including children, even newborns. If Eid falls before a baby has reached one day old, Fitrana is still recommended though not strictly obligatory. Some scholars also require it for elderly parents in your care.</p>

          <h3>Is Zakat al-Fitr the same as regular Zakat?</h3>

          <p>No. Zakat al-Fitr (Fitrana) and Zakat al-Mal (wealth Zakat) are two separate obligations. Zakat al-Fitr is a fixed per-person amount due at the end of Ramadan, regardless of your total wealth. Zakat al-Mal is 2.5% of your total zakatable wealth above the Nisab threshold, calculated annually. Both are obligatory for eligible Muslims, but they have different calculations, timings, and conditions.</p>
