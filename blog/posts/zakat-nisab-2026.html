          <p>Before you can pay Zakat, you need to answer one fundamental question: <strong>does your wealth meet the minimum threshold?</strong> That threshold is called the <em>Nisab</em>, and its value changes with the price of gold and silver. In this guide, we explain exactly what the Nisab is in 2026, how to determine which standard applies to you, and how to check whether your wealth qualifies using our <a href="../../index.html">free Zakat calculator</a>.</p>

          <h2>What Is the Nisab for Zakat?</h2>

          <p>The Nisab is the minimum amount of wealth a Muslim must possess for one full lunar year before Zakat becomes obligatory. If your net zakatable assets fall below the Nisab, you are not required to pay Zakat. If they meet or exceed it, you owe 2.5% of your total zakatable wealth.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>"And establish prayer and give Zakat, and whatever good you put forward for yourselves, you will find it with Allah."</p>
            <cite>Quran 2:110</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) established the Nisab using two precious metals: gold and silver. According to authentic hadith narrations, the gold Nisab is <strong>87.48 grams of gold</strong> (equivalent to 20 dinars), and the silver Nisab is <strong>612.36 grams of silver</strong> (equivalent to 200 dirhams). These amounts were chosen because they represented a meaningful level of surplus wealth at the time &mdash; enough that a person holding this amount could comfortably afford to share a portion with those in need.</p>

          <p>The wisdom behind the Nisab is protective: it ensures that those who possess only modest wealth are not burdened, while those with genuine surplus contribute to the welfare of the community. For a deeper explanation of Zakat's purpose and pillars, see our <a href="../../what-is-zakat.html">What is Zakat?</a> page.</p>

          <h2>Nisab Values for 2026</h2>

          <p>Because the Nisab is defined in grams of gold and silver &mdash; not in currency &mdash; its monetary value fluctuates with market prices. Below are the approximate Nisab values for 2026 based on recent market data.</p>

          <h3>Gold Standard (87.48 grams)</h3>

          <p>The gold Nisab is the equivalent of <strong>87.48 grams</strong> of pure gold (24 karat). This equals approximately:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>7.5 tola</strong> (commonly used in South Asian countries)</li>
            <li><strong>2.81 troy ounces</strong> (approximately 3 troy ounces)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>With gold prices ranging between $2,700 and $3,100 per troy ounce in early 2026, the gold Nisab in US Dollars falls approximately between <strong>$7,500 and $8,500</strong>. This means that if your total zakatable wealth is at or above this range, you likely owe Zakat. For the exact figure based on today's live gold price, use the <a href="../../index.html">ZakatEasy calculator</a>.</p>

          <h3>Silver Standard (612.36 grams)</h3>

          <p>The silver Nisab is the equivalent of <strong>612.36 grams</strong> of pure silver. This equals approximately:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>52.5 tola</strong></li>
            <li><strong>19.69 troy ounces</strong> (approximately 20 troy ounces)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>With silver trading between $28 and $35 per troy ounce in early 2026, the silver Nisab in US Dollars falls approximately between <strong>$550 and $700</strong>. As you can see, the silver threshold is dramatically lower than the gold threshold, which means many more people would be required to pay Zakat under this standard.</p>

          <p><strong>Important:</strong> These are approximate ranges based on early 2026 market prices. Gold and silver prices change every day. Always check the <a href="../../index.html">ZakatEasy calculator</a> for the exact Nisab value in your currency on the day you calculate your Zakat.</p>

          <h2>Gold Standard vs Silver Standard &mdash; Which Should You Use?</h2>

          <p>One of the most common questions Muslims face is whether to use the gold Nisab or the silver Nisab. The answer depends on which school of jurisprudence (madhab) you follow and the guidance of your local scholars.</p>

          <p><strong>Hanafi position:</strong> The Hanafi school is the most commonly followed in South Asia, Turkey, and parts of the Middle East. Hanafi scholars generally recommend using the standard that results in more people paying Zakat &mdash; which today means the <strong>silver standard</strong>. Since the silver Nisab is much lower (around $550&ndash;$700 vs. $7,500&ndash;$8,500 for gold), more Muslims will meet this threshold. This position prioritizes the benefit to the poor.</p>

          <p><strong>Shafi'i, Maliki, and Hanbali positions:</strong> These schools typically apply each metal's Nisab to the corresponding type of wealth. For gold holdings, the gold Nisab applies; for silver holdings, the silver Nisab applies. For cash and other monetary assets, scholars in these traditions often defer to the gold standard, as gold more closely represents the purchasing power originally intended by the Nisab.</p>

          <p><strong>Scholarly recommendation:</strong> Many contemporary scholars advise using whichever standard benefits the poor more. In practical terms, if you are uncertain, using the silver standard is the more cautious and generous approach. If your wealth clearly exceeds the gold Nisab, the question is moot &mdash; you owe Zakat under either standard.</p>

          <h2>How Gold Prices Affect Your Nisab</h2>

          <p>Because the Nisab is pegged to physical gold and silver, daily fluctuations in precious metal prices directly impact the monetary threshold. A rise in gold prices pushes the gold Nisab higher, potentially exempting some people, while a drop in gold prices lowers it, bringing more people into the obligation.</p>

          <p>Here are some practical tips for dealing with price fluctuations:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Check on your Zakat calculation day.</strong> You do not need to track gold prices every day. What matters is the price on the specific date you calculate your Zakat (your hawl anniversary). Use the <a href="../../index.html">ZakatEasy calculator</a> on that day for an accurate figure.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not try to time the market.</strong> Choosing to calculate on a day when gold is high (to avoid Zakat) or low (to include more people) defeats the spirit of the obligation. Pick your anniversary date and stick with it.</li>
            <li><strong>Round up when in doubt.</strong> If your wealth is right at the Nisab boundary, many scholars recommend paying Zakat to be safe. It is better to give a small amount of charity than to risk missing an obligation.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For more detail on how gold affects your Zakat calculation, read our guide on <a href="zakat-on-gold-during-ramadan.html">Zakat on gold during Ramadan</a>.</p>

          <h2>How to Check If Your Wealth Exceeds the Nisab</h2>

          <p>Determining whether you meet the Nisab is straightforward. Follow these steps:</p>

          <p><strong>Step 1: Add up all your zakatable assets.</strong> This includes cash on hand, money in bank accounts (checking, savings, fixed deposits), gold and silver (jewelry, coins, bars), investments at current market value (stocks, mutual funds, ETFs), business inventory held for resale, and any money owed to you that you expect to collect.</p>

          <p><strong>Step 2: Subtract your immediate debts.</strong> Deduct any outstanding loans, bills, or short-term liabilities due within the year. Long-term debts like mortgages are generally not deducted in full &mdash; only the amount due within the current year.</p>

          <p><strong>Step 3: Compare to the Nisab.</strong> If your net zakatable wealth (assets minus debts) meets or exceeds the current Nisab, Zakat is due at 2.5% of that total.</p>

          <p>The easiest way to do this is to use our <a href="../../index.html">free Zakat calculator</a>, which pulls live gold prices, handles currency conversion automatically, and walks you through each asset category.

          <h2>When Does the Nisab Apply?</h2>

          <p>Meeting the Nisab on a single day is not enough. Islamic law requires that your wealth remains at or above the Nisab for one complete <strong>hawl</strong> &mdash; one full lunar year (approximately 354 days) &mdash; before Zakat becomes due.</p>

          <p>Your hawl begins the moment your zakatable wealth first reaches the Nisab. If it stays at or above that level for twelve lunar months, you pay Zakat on the total amount at the end of that period. Many Muslims align their hawl with Ramadan for convenience and the additional spiritual reward of giving during the blessed month.</p>

          <p>If you are new to Zakat and unsure when your hawl started, a good approach is to choose the first day of Ramadan as your annual Zakat date going forward. Calculate your total assets on that day, compare against the Nisab, and pay 2.5% if applicable. For a complete walkthrough, see our <a href="complete-guide-zakat-ramadan-2026.html">Complete Guide to Zakat During Ramadan 2026</a>.</p>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Nisab</h2>

          <h3>Does the Nisab change every day?</h3>

          <p>Technically, yes. Because the Nisab is defined in grams of gold or silver, and precious metal prices fluctuate daily, the cash equivalent of the Nisab changes every day. However, you only need to know the Nisab value on one specific day: your Zakat calculation date (hawl anniversary). You do not need to track it daily. Simply check the current value on our <a href="../../index.html">calculator</a> when it is time to pay.</p>

          <h3>Do I use the gold or silver Nisab for cash?</h3>

          <p>For cash savings and other monetary assets, scholars differ. The Hanafi school generally applies the silver standard to all forms of wealth including cash, because it results in a lower threshold and benefits more recipients. Other schools often apply the gold standard to cash, since gold is a closer modern equivalent to the original Nisab purchasing power. If you are unsure, consult your local scholar or imam. Many contemporary scholars recommend using whichever standard benefits the poor &mdash; which in most cases is the silver standard.</p>

          <h3>What if my wealth drops below the Nisab during the year?</h3>

          <p>There is a difference of opinion among scholars on this point. According to the Hanafi school, if your wealth drops below the Nisab during the hawl but returns to or above the Nisab by the end of the year, you still owe Zakat &mdash; the brief dip does not reset your hawl. According to the Shafi'i and Hanbali schools, your wealth must remain at or above the Nisab for the entire year; if it drops below at any point, the hawl resets and begins again once the Nisab is reached. For personalized guidance, check our <a href="../../faq.html">FAQ page</a> or consult a qualified scholar.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>"Take from their wealth a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase."</p>
