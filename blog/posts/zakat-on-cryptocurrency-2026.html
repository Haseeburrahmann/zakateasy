          <p>Cryptocurrency is now held by millions of Muslims worldwide. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets have created new questions for Islamic finance scholars &mdash; chief among them: <strong>Is Zakat due on crypto?</strong> The answer, according to the majority of contemporary Islamic scholars and institutions, is yes. In this guide, we explain the Islamic ruling on cryptocurrency Zakat, which digital assets are zakatable, how to calculate your obligation, and how to use ZakatEasy to include crypto in your annual calculation.</p>

          <h2>The Scholarly Consensus on Cryptocurrency Zakat</h2>

          <p>For decades, Islamic jurisprudence addressed Zakat on gold, silver, and cash. Cryptocurrency is newer, but the principles of Islamic law are timeless. Most contemporary Islamic scholars and institutions &mdash; including AAOIFI (Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions), responses from Darul Uloom Deoband, and numerous fatwa bodies worldwide &mdash; now rule that <strong>Zakat IS due on cryptocurrency held as an investment or trading asset</strong>.</p>

          <p>The reasoning is straightforward: cryptocurrency meets all the conditions of zakatable wealth under Islamic law:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Measurable value:</strong> Every coin and token has a market price that can be determined in real currency.</li>
            <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> If you control the private keys or hold crypto in your account, you own it.</li>
            <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Crypto can be converted to cash within hours through exchanges and trading platforms.</li>
            <li><strong>Hawl (passage of time):</strong> If you have held the crypto for a full lunar year, the annual obligation applies.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This consensus reflects a principle known as <em>qiyas</em> (analogical reasoning): just as Zakat applies to cash and liquid assets, it applies to digital cash and liquid digital assets.</p>

          <h2>Which Cryptocurrencies Are Zakatable?</h2>

          <p>Not all cryptocurrencies are treated the same under Islamic law. Here is a breakdown of the main categories:</p>

          <h3>Bitcoin (BTC) — Yes</h3>

          <p>Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency and largest by market capitalization, is unanimously considered zakatable. It functions as a store of value and investment asset, meets all the criteria for zakatable wealth, and is widely recognized as such by Islamic finance scholars worldwide.</p>

          <h3>Ethereum (ETH) and Other Altcoins — Yes</h3>

          <p>Ethereum, Ripple (XRP), Litecoin, and other established cryptocurrencies are treated the same as Bitcoin. If you hold them as an investment or trading asset and they have a measurable market value, Zakat applies.</p>

          <h3>Stablecoins (USDC, USDT, BUSD, DAI) — Yes</h3>

          <p>Stablecoins are pegged to fiat currencies (usually the US Dollar) and function as digital cash. They should be treated identically to cash holdings for Zakat purposes. Include their full value in your Zakat calculation along with your other bank balances and cash.</p>

          <h3>NFTs and Digital Collectibles — Debated</h3>

          <p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and digital art have varied zakatable status depending on their liquidity and market:

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Liquid, tradeable NFTs</strong> (art sold on active marketplaces): Most scholars hold that Zakat is due at the current market value, treating them like trading inventory.</li>
            <li><strong>Illiquid or collectible NFTs</strong> (rare art with no active market): Scholars debate whether these count as zakatable wealth. Some apply the same reasoning as physical jewelry (exempt under certain schools), while others treat them as inventory. Consult a scholar if this applies to you.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3>DeFi Staking Rewards and Yield — Yes, as Income</h3>

          <p>When you earn rewards from staking or DeFi protocols (such as interest from lending platforms), most scholars treat these as <strong>income received</strong>, not pre-existing wealth. Zakat is due once you receive the rewards and they are added to your total zakatable assets. From that point, they follow the same annual calculation as your other holdings.</p>

          <h2>How to Calculate Zakat on Cryptocurrency</h2>

          <p>Calculating Zakat on crypto is straightforward once you know the principle: <strong>use the market value on your Zakat due date</strong>.</p>

          <h3>Step-by-Step</h3>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Determine your Zakat anniversary date.</strong> This is the date each lunar year (Islamic calendar) when your Zakat obligation is due. It is typically the date one full lunar year has passed since you first met the Nisab threshold.</li>
            <li><strong>Check the market price of each crypto on that date.</strong> Use a price tracking service like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko to find the historical price.</li>
            <li><strong>Calculate the total value of all crypto.</strong> Multiply your holdings by the price per coin/token. Add the values of all crypto assets together.</li>
            <li><strong>Include in total zakatable wealth.</strong> Add your crypto total to your cash, gold, silver, stocks, business inventory, and any other zakatable assets.</li>
            <li><strong>Apply the 2.5% rate.</strong> If your total zakatable wealth exceeds the Nisab threshold (approximately $7,500 &ndash; $8,500 USD based on gold prices), you owe 2.5% Zakat on the full amount.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Example: Bitcoin Holding</h3>

          <p>Suppose on your Zakat due date you own 0.5 BTC and Bitcoin is trading at $70,000 per coin.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>BTC value: 0.5 × $70,000 = $35,000</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If this is your only asset and Nisab is approximately $8,000, your total zakatable wealth is $35,000, which exceeds Nisab. Therefore:</p>

          <p style="text-align:center;font-weight:700;font-size:1.05rem;">Zakat = $35,000 × 2.5% = <strong>$875</strong></p>

          <p>If you also hold cash, stocks, or gold, add those values to the $35,000 and apply 2.5% to the combined total. For a faster calculation, enter your crypto holdings in the <a href="../../index.html">ZakatEasy calculator</a> &mdash; the tool handles all the arithmetic for you.</p>

          <h2>Crypto on Exchanges vs. Hardware Wallets</h2>

          <p>A common question: Does it matter whether crypto is held on an exchange like Coinbase or Binance, or in a private hardware wallet?</p>

          <p><strong>Answer: It does not matter.</strong> Whether your Bitcoin is stored on a centralized exchange, a self-custody hardware wallet, or a cold wallet in offline storage &mdash; if you own it, it is zakatable. The method of storage does not change the obligation. What matters is that you have ownership and control of the crypto on your Zakat anniversary date.</p>

          <h2>Trading Crypto vs. Long-Term Holdings</h2>

          <p>Does it make a difference if you are an active crypto trader versus a long-term investor? In terms of Zakat calculation, the answer is no &mdash; but the hawl (one-year period) works slightly differently:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Long-term holdings:</strong> Hold Bitcoin for a full lunar year, then pay 2.5% Zakat. Continue paying annually each year thereafter.</li>
            <li><strong>Trading and business:</strong> If you actively buy and sell crypto for profit (day trading or swing trading), you pay Zakat on the market value of your trading inventory each year, just like a business inventory. The hawl resets annually &mdash; each year you calculate Zakat on the market value on your Zakat date.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In both cases, the calculation method is the same: market value on Zakat date × 2.5%. The distinction matters mainly for understanding <em>when</em> the obligation begins, not <em>how much</em> is owed.</p>

          <h2>What if Crypto Prices Drop Right Before Your Zakat Date?</h2>

          <p>Cryptocurrency is volatile. It is not uncommon for prices to fluctuate wildly within days or weeks. What if your crypto holdings drop significantly in value right before your Zakat anniversary?</p>

          <p><strong>Use the market value on your Zakat due date.</strong> This is the principle: whatever the price is on your anniversary, you use that price. If your 1 BTC was worth $70,000 a month ago but is trading at $50,000 on your Zakat date, you calculate Zakat based on $50,000.</p>

          <p>If the price drop causes your total zakatable wealth to fall below the Nisab threshold, <strong>Zakat is not due that year</strong>. However, if your wealth recovers above Nisab in subsequent years, your Zakat obligation resumes. The hawl (one-year period) resets when wealth falls below Nisab.</p>

          <h2>Using ZakatEasy for Cryptocurrency Calculations</h2>

          <p>ZakatEasy includes a dedicated field for cryptocurrency holdings. Simply enter the current market value of your crypto portfolio in the "Cryptocurrency" field, and the calculator does the rest. The tool:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Adds your crypto value to other assets (cash, gold, silver, stocks)</li>
            <li>Applies the 2.5% Zakat rate automatically</li>
            <li>Shows your Zakat obligation in your local currency</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For ease of use, convert your crypto holdings to your local currency before entering them into ZakatEasy. For example, if you own Ethereum worth €15,000, enter €15,000 in the Cryptocurrency field (not the number of ETH tokens). The calculator handles the percentage calculation from there.</p>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <h3>Is Zakat due on Bitcoin?</h3>

          <p>Yes. The majority of contemporary Islamic scholars rule that Zakat is due on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held as an investment or for trading. Crypto meets all the conditions of zakatable wealth: it has a measurable market value, is owned and controlled by the holder, and is liquid (convertible to cash). Calculate Zakat at 2.5% of the market value of your Bitcoin on your Zakat due date. For more details, see our section on "The Scholarly Consensus on Cryptocurrency Zakat" above.</p>

          <h3>How do I value my cryptocurrency for Zakat?</h3>

          <p>Use the market price of each cryptocurrency on your Zakat due date (your hawl anniversary). Multiply the number of coins or tokens by the price per coin in your local currency. For example, if you hold 2 ETH and Ethereum is priced at $3,500 per coin on your Zakat date, the value is 2 × $3,500 = $7,000. Enter this total market value in the Cryptocurrency field of the ZakatEasy calculator.</p>

          <h3>Do I pay Zakat on stablecoins like USDC or USDT?</h3>

          <p>Yes. Stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, BUSD, and DAI are pegged to fiat currencies (usually the US Dollar) and function like digital cash. They should be treated the same as cash holdings for Zakat purposes. Include their full value in your Zakat calculation along with your other cash and bank balances. There is no discount or exemption for stablecoins &mdash; they count as zakatable wealth at full value.</p>

          <h3>Is there Zakat on DeFi earnings and staking rewards?</h3>

          <p>Yes, but the approach differs from pre-existing holdings. Most scholars treat DeFi yields and staking rewards as <strong>income</strong> received. Zakat is due once you receive the rewards and they are added to your total zakatable wealth. If your total wealth (including staking rewards) exceeds the Nisab and has been above Nisab for a full lunar year, you owe 2.5% Zakat on the total. Track when you receive each reward so you know when the one-year period begins for that income.</p>
