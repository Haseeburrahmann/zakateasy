        <!-- FAQ 1 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            How is the Nisab calculated?
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The Nisab is the minimum amount of wealth a Muslim must possess for Zakat to become obligatory. It is calculated based on the value of either:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Gold:</strong> 87.48 grams (7.5 tola) of gold</li>
              <li><strong>Silver:</strong> 612.36 grams (52.5 tola) of silver</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most contemporary scholars recommend using the <strong>gold standard</strong> as it provides a higher, more stable threshold. The dollar value of Nisab changes daily with market prices. ZakatEasy updates the Nisab value daily based on current gold prices.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ 2 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            Do I pay Zakat on my house?
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>No.</strong> Your primary residence is exempt from Zakat. Personal property used for daily living (home, car, furniture, clothing) is not subject to Zakat.</p>
            <p>However, if you own <strong>investment or rental properties</strong>, the situation differs. Zakat is not due on the property value itself, but any <strong>rental income saved</strong> over the year would be included in your zakatable wealth calculation.</p>
            <p>If you buy and sell property as a business (real estate trading), the properties held for resale are considered business inventory and are subject to Zakat.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ 3 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            What about retirement accounts (401k, IRA, pension)?
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>This is a topic where scholars have different opinions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>View 1:</strong> Zakat is due on the full current value of the account, since it represents your wealth even if not yet withdrawn.</li>
              <li><strong>View 2:</strong> Zakat is only due on voluntary contributions and their growth (not employer matches or mandatory contributions).</li>
              <li><strong>View 3:</strong> Zakat is due only when funds are actually withdrawn and in your possession.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Given the complexity, we recommend consulting a qualified Islamic scholar or mufti who can advise based on your specific retirement plan structure. If uncertain, many scholars advise paying Zakat on the accessible portion to be safe.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ 4 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            Can I give Zakat to family members?
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The general rule is that you <strong>cannot</strong> give Zakat to people you are financially responsible for (your dependents), such as your:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Spouse</li>
              <li>Parents and grandparents</li>
              <li>Children and grandchildren</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, you <strong>can</strong> give Zakat to other relatives who are eligible (siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, in-laws) if they fall into one of the eight categories of Zakat recipients. In fact, giving Zakat to eligible relatives carries <strong>double reward</strong> &mdash; the reward of Zakat and the reward of maintaining family ties.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ 5 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            Should I use the gold or silver Nisab standard?
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>There is a significant difference between the gold and silver Nisab values today. The silver Nisab is much lower (often around $400-500 USD), while the gold Nisab is typically several thousand dollars.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Hanafi school</strong> traditionally recommends using whichever standard is lower (silver), as it is more beneficial to the poor. However, most <strong>contemporary scholars</strong> and major Islamic institutions recommend the <strong>gold standard</strong> because:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Gold has maintained its purchasing power better over time</li>
              <li>The silver standard would make Zakat obligatory on people who are themselves in financial difficulty</li>
              <li>It better reflects the original intent of the Nisab threshold</li>
            </ul>
            <p>ZakatEasy uses the <strong>gold standard (87.48 grams)</strong> as its default, following the recommendation of most contemporary scholars.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ 6 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            Is Zakat due on gold jewelry I wear daily?
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>This depends on which school of thought you follow:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Hanafi school:</strong> Zakat is due on all gold and silver, including personal jewelry worn regularly.</li>
              <li><strong>Shafi'i, Maliki, and Hanbali schools:</strong> Jewelry worn regularly for personal use is generally exempt from Zakat, as long as it is within customary amounts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you follow the Hanafi school, include your gold jewelry's value in the calculator. If you follow other schools, you may exclude regularly-worn personal jewelry. When in doubt, consult your local scholar.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ 7 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            When should I pay my Zakat?
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Zakat becomes due after you have possessed wealth at or above the Nisab for <strong>one complete lunar year (hawl)</strong>. You should:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pick a consistent annual date (many use 1st Ramadan or their birthday on the Hijri calendar)</li>
              <li>Calculate your total zakatable wealth on that date</li>
              <li>Pay 2.5% if your net wealth meets the Nisab</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While Zakat can be paid any time during the year, many Muslims prefer paying during <strong>Ramadan</strong> for the increased spiritual rewards. You can also pay Zakat in advance (before the year is complete) if you anticipate meeting the threshold.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ 8 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            Is Zakat due on stocks and investments?
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>Yes.</strong> Zakat is generally due on stocks and investments. The method depends on your intent:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Trading stocks (bought to sell):</strong> Zakat is due on the current market value of your entire portfolio.</li>
              <li><strong>Long-term investments (held for dividends/growth):</strong> Some scholars say Zakat is due on dividends received, while others include the full market value. The more cautious approach is to include the market value.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>ZakatEasy calculates Zakat on the total market value you enter. Include the current value of all your investment accounts.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ 9 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            Can I pay Zakat in installments?
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>Yes.</strong> While it is preferable to pay the full amount at once when it becomes due, scholars permit paying Zakat in installments throughout the year, especially if the total amount is large. Some scholars even recommend paying Zakat monthly (1/12 of the annual amount) to provide a steady flow of support to recipients.</p>
            <p>The key is to ensure the full amount is paid by the time your next Zakat anniversary comes around.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ 10 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            What is Zakat al-Fitr? Is it different from regular Zakat?
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>Yes, they are different:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Zakat (Zakat al-Mal):</strong> Annual obligation based on wealth. Calculated at 2.5% of net zakatable wealth above Nisab. This is what ZakatEasy calculates.</li>
              <li><strong>Zakat al-Fitr (Fitrana):</strong> A separate, smaller payment due at the end of Ramadan before Eid prayer. It is obligatory on every Muslim (including children), regardless of wealth level. The amount is equivalent to one sa' of food (approximately 2.5-3 kg) or its monetary equivalent (typically $10-15 per person).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both are obligatory, but they serve different purposes and are calculated differently.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ 11 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            Do I deduct my mortgage from my assets?
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Scholars differ on this matter:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Traditional view:</strong> Only deduct debts that are <strong>immediately due</strong> (current month's mortgage payment, not the entire loan balance).</li>
              <li><strong>Some contemporary scholars:</strong> Allow deducting up to 12 months of upcoming payments from zakatable wealth.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The majority view is that you should <strong>only deduct the immediately due amount</strong> (your current monthly payment if overdue), not the full mortgage balance. This is because the mortgage is a long-term debt spread over many years.</p>
            <p>Enter your immediately due debts and bills in the liabilities section of the calculator. Consult a scholar for complex debt situations.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ 12 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            Is Zakat due on money I owe to others?
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>If you have loaned money to someone, that money is still considered part of your wealth. However, whether Zakat is due depends on the likelihood of repayment:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Good debt (likely to be repaid):</strong> Zakat is due on this amount. Include it in your assets.</li>
              <li><strong>Doubtful debt (uncertain repayment):</strong> Some scholars say you should still count it; others say you can exclude it until received. When received, pay Zakat for the past years.</li>
              <li><strong>Bad debt (unlikely to be repaid):</strong> Not subject to Zakat until actually recovered.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ 13 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            Can I give Zakat to non-Muslims?
            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The majority of scholars hold that Zakat should be given to <strong>Muslim recipients</strong> who fall into the eight categories mentioned in Quran 9:60. However, there are nuances:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>One of the eight categories is "those whose hearts are to be reconciled" (<em>al-mu'allafatu qulubuhum</em>), which can include non-Muslims in certain interpretations.</li>
              <li>For general charity to non-Muslims, <strong>Sadaqah</strong> (voluntary charity) is encouraged and has no restrictions on recipients.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Consult your local scholar for guidance specific to your community and circumstances.</p>
